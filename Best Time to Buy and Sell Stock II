//You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
//On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
//Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length-1;i++){
            if(prices[i+1]>prices[i]){
                profit+=prices[i+1]-prices[i];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}

Points to consider :
Draw a graph to get better understanding of stock problems 
Here we can find loacl maxima and loacl minima and sum it up for answer 
Else follow the simple approach
